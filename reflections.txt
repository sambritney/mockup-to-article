I’ve learned some basics about HTML elements and how it’s important to layout your code in neat, readable format. This includes using indentation to display hierarchy.

I think HTML syntax has been pretty easy to grasp.

I didn’t find this project too challenging as I felt I had a decent grasp of this topic. If anything, learning spacing and layout can be a challenge.

Using the MDN was the key to finding answers to things I didn’t already know for this project.
